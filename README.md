# Data Structures are categorized into 
#       - Primitive
#       - Non-Primitive
#   
#   Primitive                                                   
#            - Integer
#            - Float
#            - String
#            - Boolean
# 
#  Non-Primitive
#           - List
#              => Liner(Stack, Queue)
#              => Non-Liner(Graph, Tree)
#           - Tuple  
#           - Set
#           - Dictionary
#           - Array
#           - File

# Tree can have further types - Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST) and Heaps
# Tree will have DFS (Depth First Search - preorder, inorder, postorder) and BFS (Breadth First Search)


# Algorithms are classified into 3 categories 
#   - Greedy Algo
#   - Divide & Conquer
#   - Dynamic Programming

# Algo Design Probelm should be followed by CICCT canvas i.e.
#   - Constraints
#   - Ideas
#   - Complexity (Time & Space)
#   - Code
#   - Test Cases

# Time & Space Complexity
# Big O - Worst case scenario and time taken by the algo
# Omega - Best case scenarion and time taken by the algo
# Theta - Intermediate case between worst and best case of algo runtime
