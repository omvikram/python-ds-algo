# Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity C to get the maximum total value
#  in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values 
#  and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity, 
#  find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C. 
# You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

# Case 1: The item is included in the optimal subset.
# Case 2: The item is not included in the optimal set.

# of 0-1 Knapsack Problem
